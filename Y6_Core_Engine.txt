# Introduction
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# This is a compilation of all the various bug fixes and upgrades dedicated to
# making RPG Maker VX and RGSS2 run efficiently and effectively. It is highly
# recommended that you place this script at the top of your script listing (but
# under Materials) so that as many Y6 scripts work correctly and properly.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Animation Speed Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RPG Maker VX uses the same animation speed that of RPG Maker XP. However, for
# XP, the default FPS is 40 frames per second whereas in RPG Maker VX, the FPS
# is 60 frames per second. This fix will up the animation speed unless decided
# otherwise by the user.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Animation Overlay Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In battle, when an animation targeting the whole screen is being used, the
# animation is actually played multiple times. This causes an exponentially
# growing overlay in both graphics and sound and plays out rather choppy, too.
# The fix will cause the animation to play only once if it is an overlay. And
# unlike the YERD version, this one also allows non-overlayed enemies to flash.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Battle Time Over Window Bug
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When a battle ends because of a timer, windows that were left open remain
# open by default. Thus, they can never be terminated unless the game were to
# be reset. This is fixed so that any windows that were left open at a time
# based termination of the battle will automatically be disposed.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Battle Turn Order Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For those that are using the default battle system, you've probably realized
# sooner or later that turn order is only calculated once at the start of each
# turn and retains that order even if speed has been changed in between turns.
# This means that enemies which your actors have slowed on the same turn will
# still act in the same order calculated for that turn. Agility status effects
# and the like do not take effect until the following turn, which may become
# rather useless for some. This script fixes that and recalculates turn order
# after each and every action.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Damage Variance Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Skills have a variable called variance that gives them a random modifier for
# damage so that it doesn't appear the same as always. However, the formula for
# applying variance for a damage skill and the formula for a healing skill are
# completely incompatible since the variance treats healing calculations as
# damage calculations. This fix will adjust the calculations properly.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Disposed Window Bug
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sometimes when a window is disposed but hasn't been set to nil, the game will
# crash without even telling you which window has been disposed. Although this
# will prevent the crash, in $TEST and $BTEST mode (test play mode), a pop up
# appears to list which window variable needs to be cleared so you can maximize
# your code better. The latter feature is mostly for debug purposes.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Enemy Reappear Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the event that a state is applied to a monster and that monster dies, if
# the state's timer runs out, a message appears that the monster is suddenly
# cured of poison or whatever. Not only does the message appear, the monster's
# sprite reappears in battle, too. The monster, however, is not selectable.
# This script  will fix that problem by halting the state removal process.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Game Interpreter Change Variable Command
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, the English version of RPG Maker VX has faulty coding for the
# ever used Control Variables event command. The Game Interpreter Fix corrects
# the problem and makes it function as it should.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Menu Actor Switch Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When using L or R to switch between actors in the Skill and Equip menus, what
# is strange is that upon leaving those menus and selecting the Skill or Equip
# option again, it will not target the newly switched actor, but rather, the
# previous. This little fix will help update that method.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Message Window Actor Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Previously, when using \n[0] in the message window, it would not return the
# leading actor like it did normally before in RPG Maker 2000 and 2003. Now,
# it will have the functionality to do so again. And as an added bonus, using
# the \f[0] tag will cause the message window to use the leading actor's face.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Prevent Skill Scene Actor Switch
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, pressing L and R in the Skill Scene causes the scene to swap to
# the previous actor and next actor respectively. This is problematic if the
# actor has a lot of skills that would require scrolling and thus, the L and R
# buttons will be locked if more than 22 skills are present (the amount that
# would require L and R to scroll). This amount is adjustable in the module to
# change accordingly to different sized lists should the Skill Scene be
# affected by other scripts.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: State Resistance Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When RPG Maker VX checks if an enemy is resistant against a certain state for
# applying states, it will always return false regardless of what probability
# rate given to the enemy. This script will change the definition altogether for
# enemies and returns the check as true if the state has a working chance of
# 10% or lower against that particular enemy. Nothing will be considered
# resistant against the death state, however.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Usable Items Only Fix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This prevents non-battle usable items to be included into the item menu
# during battle. What VX did originally was allow any kind of item so long as
# it was an item type (not weapon type or armour type) despite whether or not
# it was usable in battle. This one just limits the item menu to the ones
# usable in a battle. For those with KGC's Usable Equipment script, this script
# is compatible with it.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug Fix: Window Interface Fixes
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script will automatically adjust visible gauges, fonts, and other items
# to prevent them from glitching up. These glitches include HP and MP gauges
# extending past their default limits, font colours not adjusting to the proper
# window colour based on the window skin, and more.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Font Adjustment and Text Outlines
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Adjust the default font the game will use here in addition to selecting the
# option to use outlines for text instead of a shadow. Outlines allow for
# improved visibility for the player.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Help Window Upgrade
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now, you can use \n[x] and \v[x] in the help window. Using \n[0] will return
# the user's name if applicable. If not, the "User" will be returned. Use this
# to personalize the description windows a bit more. Colour codes not included
# to preserve engine efficiency.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Numeric Digit Grouping
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This will change various scenes to display numbers in groups where they are
# separated by a comma every three digits. Thus, a number like 1234567 will
# show up as 1,234,567. This allows for players to read numbers quicker.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Screen Resizing
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Implemented as a core item since the resolution size for VX is too limiting.
# Although you may not increase the resolution more than 640x480, any custom
# resolution less than it (but over 110x10) can be made. The map screens and
# default menus will be automatically adjusted to work with the new resolution
# size. Any other scripts that have custom scenes may or may not be compatible
# with a non-default resolution size.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Shown States Upgrade
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# More technical RPG's use states to produce additional effects. However, the
# creators of those games would encounter problems if they were to use states
# with invisible icons. This fix will cause states with an icon index of 0 to
# be omitted from the shown states. The upgrade of this script will also allow
# the option to display the number of turns left for a state in the upper left
# corner of that state.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New Features: Window Settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# With this, you can change the colours used for the gauges, the default height
# of gauges, and whatnot. You may also change the colours used for various text
# such as HP, MP, System Colour Text, Improvements, Downgrades, etc.
# 
#==============================================================================
# Instructions
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# To install this script, open up your script editor and copy/paste this script
# to an open slot below Бе Materials but above Бе Main. Remember to save.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# State Tags - Insert the following tags into State noteboxes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <turn colour: x>
# If you want certain states to display the turns remaining in a different
# colour for the sake of distinguishing them or so they'll show up better on
# the state due to colour incompatibility, use this tag in the state's notebox.
# x is equal to the text colour value found in your window skin file.
# 
# <hide state>
# This will cause the state to be not drawn even if it has has no icon. The
# state will appear elsewhere in other state lists, but not in the actor window
# where it'll be extremely intrusive.
# 
#==============================================================================
# Compatibility
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# Note: This script may not work with former Yanfly Engine scripts.
#       Use Yanfly Engine 6 scripts to work with this if available.

    # - Resize Screen Width and Height -
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # RPG Maker VX has the option of having larger width and height for your
    # games. Resizing the width and height will have the following changes:
    # 
    #              Default   Resized   Min Tiles Default   Min Tiles New
    #    Width       544       640           17                 20

    # 
    # * Note: Maximum width is 640 while maximum height is 480.
    #         Minimum width is 110 while maximum height is 10.
    #         These are limitations set by RPG Maker VX's engine.
    # 
    # By selecting resize, all of the default menus will have their windows
    # adjusted, but scripts provided by non-Yanfly Engine sources may or may
    # not adjust themselves properly.
